# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## Introduction
This repository contains the requirement analysis documentation for a **Booking Management System**.  
The goal is to simulate a real-world requirement analysis phase of the **Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)**.  

It covers:  
- Explanation of requirement analysis  
- Types of requirements (functional and non-functional)  
- Key activities in requirement analysis  
- Use case diagrams for the booking system  
- Acceptance criteria examples  

This structured documentation provides a strong foundation for the design and development phases of the project.

## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is a critical phase in the **Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)** where the project team **gathers, analyzes, and defines** the requirements of the software product to be developed.  

It ensures that:  
- Stakeholders have a clear and mutual understanding of what the system should do.  
- Ambiguities and misunderstandings are reduced early in the process.  
- Development teams have a precise roadmap for implementation.  

This process sets the foundation for the **design, development, and testing** phases, making sure the final product aligns with stakeholder needs and business objectives.
