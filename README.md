# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## Introduction
This repository contains the requirement analysis documentation for a **Booking Management System**.  
The goal is to simulate a real-world requirement analysis phase of the **Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)**.  

It covers:  
- Explanation of requirement analysis  
- Types of requirements (functional and non-functional)  
- Key activities in requirement analysis  
- Use case diagrams for the booking system  
- Acceptance criteria examples  

This structured documentation provides a strong foundation for the design and development phases of the project.

## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is a critical phase in the **Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)** where the project team **gathers, analyzes, and defines** the requirements of the software product to be developed.  

It ensures that:  
- Stakeholders have a clear and mutual understanding of what the system should do.  
- Ambiguities and misunderstandings are reduced early in the process.  
- Development teams have a precise roadmap for implementation.  

This process sets the foundation for the **design, development, and testing** phases, making sure the final product aligns with stakeholder needs and business objectives.

## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

Requirement Analysis plays a vital role in the **Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)** because it provides a clear direction for the project.  

Key reasons include:  

1. **Clarity and Understanding**  
   - Helps stakeholders and developers achieve a shared understanding of the project goals.  
   - Reduces ambiguity and prevents miscommunication.  

2. **Scope Definition**  
   - Clearly defines the project scope and prevents scope creep.  
   - Ensures that the team only builds what is required.  

3. **Basis for Design and Development**  
   - Provides a strong foundation for system design, architecture, and development.  
   - Ensures that developers work towards well-defined requirements.  

4. **Cost and Time Estimation**  
   - Makes it possible to estimate resources, budget, and timelines more accurately.  
   - Prevents costly rework by catching issues early.  

5. **Quality Assurance**  
   - Ensures the final product meets user expectations and business needs.  
   - Improves customer satisfaction and product reliability.  


## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

Requirement Analysis consists of several important activities that ensure the system is well-understood before development begins.  

### 1. Requirement Gathering üóÇÔ∏è
- **Interviews:** Collect detailed information from stakeholders.  
- **Surveys/Questionnaires:** Capture requirements from a larger audience.  
- **Workshops:** Collaborate with stakeholders to refine needs.  
- **Observation:** Study end-users in their real environment.  
- **Document Analysis:** Review existing systems and documentation.  

### 2. Requirement Elicitation ‚úçÔ∏è
- **Brainstorming:** Generate ideas and explore possible solutions.  
- **Focus Groups:** Conduct group discussions with selected stakeholders.  
- **Prototyping:** Use mockups or prototypes to clarify requirements.  

### 3. Requirement Documentation üìö
- **Requirement Specification Document (SRS):** Formal record of all requirements.  
- **User Stories:** Describe functionalities from the user‚Äôs perspective.  
- **Use Cases:** Show system interactions through diagrams.  

### 4. Requirement Analysis and Modeling üìä
- **Prioritization:** Rank requirements based on importance and impact.  
- **Feasibility Analysis:** Assess if requirements are realistic within constraints.  
- **Modeling:** Create diagrams (e.g., DFDs, ER diagrams) to visualize requirements.  

### 5. Requirement Validation ‚úÖ
- **Review and Approval:** Confirm requirements with stakeholders.  
- **Acceptance Criteria:** Define measurable conditions for success.  
- **Traceability:** Ensure all requirements are covered during development and testing.
