# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## Introduction
This repository contains the requirement analysis documentation for a **Booking Management System**.  
The goal is to simulate a real-world requirement analysis phase of the **Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)**.  

It covers:  
- Explanation of requirement analysis  
- Types of requirements (functional and non-functional)  
- Key activities in requirement analysis  
- Use case diagrams for the booking system  
- Acceptance criteria examples  

This structured documentation provides a strong foundation for the design and development phases of the project.
